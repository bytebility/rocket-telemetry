Rocket Telemetry Logger, Rev. 2
----

The second revision of my rocket telemetry rig, built on an [ArduIMU v3](https://code.google.com/p/ardu-imu/wiki/IntroductionPage).

It includes a [MPL3115A2 Altitude/Pressure Sensor](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11084), an [Adafruit MicroSD board](https://www.adafruit.com/products/254) to save raw data to and an [XBee Pro 900mhz](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9097) radio for ground communication.  Also included is a [50 Channel GP-635T GPS Receiver](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11571).

The idea being raw data is saved to a MicroSD card while "state" data, that is current positional data, is transmitted to the ground for (near) real time display.
